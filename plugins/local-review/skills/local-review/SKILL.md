name: local-review
description: Use when the user asks for a code review of uncommitted local changes (staged or unstaged) before commit. Runs a multi-agent review for bugs, security (OWASP), CLAUDE.md compliance, type safety, and simplification, then applies a confidence filter before reporting.

Provide a code review for uncommitted local changes (both staged and unstaged).

**Optional Focus**: If the user's request includes a focus area or extra context (e.g., "focus on auth logic", "check error handling in the new API", "I refactored the payment flow"), treat it as the primary focus for the review. The focus might be:
- A specific area to focus on (e.g., "focus on the payment flow")
- Context about what changed (e.g., "I refactored the auth module")
- Specific concerns to check (e.g., "make sure the error handling is correct")
- A method or file to prioritize (e.g., "check the handleSubmit function")

When a focus is provided, all review agents should:
1. Prioritize issues related to the focus area
2. Provide more detailed analysis of the focused area
3. Still check for critical issues elsewhere, but weight the focus area higher

To do this, follow these steps precisely:

1. Use a claude-opus-4-6 agent to check the current state of the working directory:
   - Run `git status` to see what files have changes
   - Run `git diff` for unstaged changes and `git diff --staged` for staged changes
   - If there are no changes, do not proceed and inform the user
   - Return a summary of what files changed and the nature of the changes
   - If a focus was provided, note which files/changes are most relevant to that focus

2. Use another Haiku agent to find any relevant CLAUDE.md files: the root CLAUDE.md file (if one exists), as well as any CLAUDE.md files in the directories containing modified files

3. Then, launch 5 parallel Sonnet agents to independently code review the changes. Each agent should read the full file context when needed. **If a focus was provided, include it in each agent's prompt so they prioritize that area.** The agents should return a list of issues and the reason each issue was flagged:
   a. Agent #1: Audit the changes to make sure they comply with any CLAUDE.md guidelines found. Note that CLAUDE.md is guidance for Claude as it writes code, so not all instructions will be applicable during code review.
   b. Agent #2: Understand the goal of the changes, then read the file changes, then scan for bugs, logic errors, and edge cases. Focus on significant bugs, avoid nitpicks. Check for: null/undefined issues, off-by-one errors, race conditions, resource leaks, error handling gaps.
   c. Agent #3: Scan for security vulnerabilities (OWASP top 10): injection flaws, XSS, auth bypass, sensitive data exposure, insecure dependencies, etc.
   d. Agent #4: Check for TypeScript type safety issues, performance problems, and code quality concerns that would fail code review.
   e. Agent #5 (Code Simplifier): You are an expert code simplification specialist focused on enhancing code clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving exact functionality. Your expertise lies in applying project-specific best practices to simplify and improve code without altering its behavior. You prioritize readable, explicit code over overly compact solutions.

      Analyze the changed code and flag issues related to:

      1. **Preserve Functionality**: Flag any simplification that would change what the code does - only how it does it matters. All original features, outputs, and behaviors must remain intact.

      2. **Apply Project Standards**: Flag violations of coding standards from CLAUDE.md including:
         - Use ES modules with proper import sorting and extensions
         - Prefer `function` keyword over arrow functions
         - Use explicit return type annotations for top-level functions
         - Follow proper React component patterns with explicit Props types
         - Use proper error handling patterns (avoid try/catch when possible)
         - Maintain consistent naming conventions

      3. **Enhance Clarity**: Flag code that could be simplified by:
         - Reducing unnecessary complexity and nesting
         - Eliminating redundant code and abstractions
         - Improving readability through clear variable and function names
         - Consolidating related logic
         - Removing unnecessary comments that describe obvious code
         - IMPORTANT: Flag nested ternary operators - prefer switch statements or if/else chains for multiple conditions
         - Choose clarity over brevity - explicit code is often better than overly compact code

      4. **Maintain Balance**: Do NOT flag issues that would lead to over-simplification:
         - Avoid reducing code clarity or maintainability
         - Avoid creating overly clever solutions that are hard to understand
         - Avoid combining too many concerns into single functions or components
         - Avoid removing helpful abstractions that improve code organization
         - Avoid prioritizing "fewer lines" over readability (e.g., nested ternaries, dense one-liners)
         - Avoid making the code harder to debug or extend

      Return a list of code clarity and maintainability issues found in the changed code.

4. For each issue found in #3, launch a parallel Haiku agent that takes the issue description and CLAUDE.md files (from step 2), and returns a confidence score from 0-100. The scale is:
   a. 0: Not confident at all. This is a false positive that doesn't stand up to light scrutiny, or is a pre-existing issue.
   b. 25: Somewhat confident. This might be a real issue, but may also be a false positive. If the issue is stylistic, it was not explicitly called out in CLAUDE.md.
   c. 50: Moderately confident. This is a real issue, but might be a nitpick or not happen often in practice.
   d. 75: Highly confident. Verified this is very likely a real issue that will be hit in practice. Very important and will directly impact functionality.
   e. 100: Absolutely certain. Confirmed this is definitely a real issue that will happen frequently.


5. Present the filtered issues to the user, grouped by severity:
   - Critical (score 95-100): Must fix before committing
   - Warning (score 80-94): Should consider fixing
   - Simplification (from Agent #5): Code clarity improvements to consider

Examples of false positives to filter out in steps 3 and 4:

- Pre-existing issues (not introduced in current changes)
- Pedantic nitpicks that a senior engineer wouldn't call out
- Issues that a linter, typechecker, or compiler would catch
- General code quality issues unless explicitly required in CLAUDE.md
- Issues silenced by lint ignore comments
- Changes in functionality that are likely intentional

Notes:

- Do not attempt to build or typecheck the app
- Make a todo list first
- For each issue, include:
  - File path and line number
  - Brief description of the problem
  - Why it matters
  - Suggested fix (with code snippet if helpful)
- If no issues found, confirm the code looks good for commit
